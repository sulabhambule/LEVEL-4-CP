  /*
   * A graph is said to be bioartite, if and only if you could color the nodes in
   * white and black and in the end for every nodes, its nighbour is in different
   * color.
   * if the graph is no cycle the it is always bipartite.
   * if the graph has a odd cycle the the graph is a non - bipartites
   * 
   * 1) check if the graph has odd length cycle (so we need to only check if the
   * graph is the bipartite)
